2. The calculator interface will be displayed with a black background and buttons for numbers, operators, and other functionalities.
3. Click on the number buttons to enter the digits of the numbers you want to calculate.
4. Click on the operator buttons (+, -, *, /) to choose the desired arithmetic operation.
5. After entering the first number, select an operator, then enter the second number.
6. Click the "=" button to display the result of the calculation in the display field.
7. To perform another calculation, you can continue entering numbers and selecting operators as needed.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: For creating the structure and layout of the calculator.
- CSS3: For styling the user interface and providing a visually appealing design.
- JavaScript: For implementing the logic and handling user interactions.

## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the Calculator App is functional and easy to use, there are several ways it could be further improved:

- Memory Functionality: Add memory functions such as memory recall, memory clear, and memory addition/subtraction.
- Scientific Calculator: Incorporate advanced functionalities like trigonometric functions, logarithms, and exponentiation for more complex calculations.
- Keyboard Support: Implement keyboard support to allow users to enter numbers and operators using their keyboard.
- History Feature: Add a history feature to display a list of previous calculations performed during the session.
